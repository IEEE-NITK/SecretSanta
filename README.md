# Secret Santa

## About
- This is a simple Python script to automate the process of allotting a Secret Santa for all the participants! 
- Kindly find the files called `santa.py` and `forget_nickname.py` in the src folder
- In case you want to know the explanation of how the code works, kindly refer the Wiki!

## What Do The Users Have To Do?

### Stage 1
- Fill up a Google Form which can be found [here](https://goo.gl/forms/wxBnq3UlFquf0A9Q2). The Form should contain your name, nickname and Email Address.

### Stage 2
- Fill up a Excel Sheet which will be generated after the Google Form is closed which will contain a list of nicknames. You have to choose one name and write **your nickname** in the column next to any nickname that you want!

## What The Users Will Recieve?

### Stage 1
- After filling up the Google Form the users will get a mail (on Sunday most probably after the form is closed) to their Email ID informing them of the nickname that they've chosen in case they forget it! :smile:

### Stage 2
- After filling the Excel Sheet and choosing a nickname the users will recieve an Email telling them the name of the person for whom they'll be Secret Santa this year!
